## Hi there (•_•)! This is an application I created a few days ago this was made in the Java language.
## I made the four basic operations of CRUD!

## **First things first ❗**
###  💭 *If you are already a programmer and know how to use SQL and the java Library, I hope that my code is easy to read.*
1. First, you have to go to the folder named connection.💬
    * **When you enter it,  you will see 3 variables: Url, User and Password**
    * **If you don't have a password just dont't create a variable for it and check if the command to the connection seems like this "DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, null);"**
    * **The three informations must be in your own SQL database in the Database connection settings**
    * **Change the values of these variables to the your own values.**
2. This database was made based on my own, so this means that each of the SQL commands was created based on my own database.💬
    * **Please you must have to change this comands based on your Database.You have to do this in all the classes of CRUD**
